# Feature Engineering - Ames Housing Dataset  

This repository contains our Feature Engineering assignment, where we developed three new features based on the Ames Housing dataset to enhance predictive modeling for housing prices.  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to engineer meaningful features from the existing data, ensuring that each feature added value to predictive models. Key requirements included:  
- Creating original and practical features based on real-world applications.  
- Ensuring that each new feature applies to all rows in the dataset.  
- Providing logical reasoning and external sources to justify feature choices.  

## Key Learnings  
- The impact of well-designed features on model performance.  
- Data manipulation techniques for handling real-world datasets.  
- The importance of structured documentation and citations in data science projects.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and documentation  
- Excel for dataset exploration  

## Team  
This project was developed by a team of five students as part of our Master's in Business Analytics coursework. It was a valuable opportunity to apply theoretical concepts to real-world data and improve our data engineering skills.
